    <p>Our inspiration for our website came from the different point of views we all had
       when we discussed what we envisioned, we didn't want to exclude anyone’s ideas so
        we wanted to create a website that was going to merge our ideas together. With that
         we came up with three topics that we each were passionate about Stephanie was interested 
         in fashion, Isabella wanted to spread a more healthy lifestyle, and Alondra wanted bring 
         awareness to people on what is going on around in the world. We were first inspired by a 
         few websites like Teen Vogue and Vogue, then after that we started to think of what we wanted
          to include on each of the pages. We then separated into our own topic and started a rough draft 
          of what was going to be included in each web page.One of the main reason why  stephanie wanted 
          to choose fashion was because “Fashion can be used to communicate a message on a larger scale,
           for example the intersection of fashion and social movements in a comprehensive way. Fashion 
           has always been a powerful political tool used to communicate a message, positive or negative,
           like the suffragettes and the Black Panthers”. Isabella was leaning more on the food/cooking side 
           and she was able to share a variety of meals that can be made at home and that are also more 
           nutritious. Alondra at the beginning wanted to shed light on the deportations that have recently 
           been happening but she thought that making a main page that talked about news all around would be 
           more beneficial because then people would be globally informed.

      <p>Hi I'm Isabella, I am going to be a junior and I recently discovered my love for
         computer science through Girls Who Code. I hope to major in computer science and 
         I am excited for the future. I love learning creating and learning new things. 
         My favorite thing to do on my free time is hang out with friends and my loving maltipoo.  </p>

      <p>The Summer of 2019 I became immersed in the Girls Who Code program and quickly 
        fell in love with code. This upcoming year I will become a senior and once I go to
         college I plan to study computer science. I love to spend my time trying new foods, playing basketball, and getting involved in my community.</p>

      <h3>Alondra Vera </h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Founder</p>
      <p> I'm currently a senior at Vaughn International Studies Academy,
        I enjoy coding and web design. I would like to work at a social media company as a software engineer
      or web developer. I also like psychology and learning about how the brain works, so I hope
    to combine computer science with psychology.                                    </p>
