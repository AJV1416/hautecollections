      <h3>Bella Hadid Shows Why a Summer Cardigan Is a Style Win</h3>
      <p align="left">Yesterday, the model went out in New York City wearing the perfect summer-night ensemble. She knows the power of a good cardigan, even in a season where it may not seem an obvious first choice. She chose one in white by Danielle Guizio, fastening just the top button to reveal slinky, form-fitting knit pieces underneath, including a tank and skirt by Hesperios.</p>

      <h3>Meet the New It Bag Set to Dominate New York Fashion Week</h3>
      <p align="left">First seen at Gucci’s Resort 2020 show, the Italian label is launching the 1955 Horsebit handbag this month, a new style that references Gucci’s archives from the ’50s. The revived interpretation features the brand’s iconic horsebit clasp, the first time the signature detail has been used on a bag since Alessandro Michele took the helm in 2015.</p>

      <h3>Stars Embraced Statement Florals and “Ugly” Shoes</h3>
      <p align="left">Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid continued to make the case for bike shorts, elevating the Eighties laughingstock to athleisure essential. In London Jenner wore hers with a belted Prince of Wales jacket from Prada and studded brogues. Hadid slipped on her biker shorts to test-drive Wardrobe.NYC’s new collaboration with Levi’s—specifically, a Christine Centenera designed cropped denim jacket over matching shirt.</p>

      <h3>SZA Brings Sustainable Fashion to Festival Style</h3>
      <p align="left"> Since the singer-songwriter announced the launch of Ctrl Fishing Company—a brand committed to saving the ocean, as she framed it in an Instagram story last year—she has debuted numerous different pieces from the collection. She gave us an initial peek at the upcoming line this past December with a colorful, ’80s-inspired windbreaker with the words “Puck Flastic” embroidered onto it in bold lettering, and just a few months ago, she showed off one of Ctrl Fishing Company’s upcycled shirts, patched together from old tie dye tees.</p>

      <h3>See the Best Street Style From Pitchfork Fest</h3>
      <p align="left">Chicago is brutally cold in the winter and unfathomably humid in the summer, but there is a delightful warmth to the city that lies in direct opposition to those two extremes. One can see it in the final weeks of July when Pitchfork Festival descends upon the West Loop’s Union Park.</p>
