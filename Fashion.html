      <p align="left">Fresh off this new album release, Smith is now showcasing the other major part of his creative venture. The musician made an appearance on the streets of Paris earlier today, documenting the literal traffic-stopping moment on Instagram. Rather than lean into classic French menswear style though, he doubled down on the tie-dye trend, wearing orange and magenta-swirled pieces from his own line and New Balance sneakers (he happens to star in the athletic brand's new campaign). Even when he’s embracing the season’s most ubiquitous print, Smith’s style is totally singular.

      <p align="left">What exactly did the year’s best dressed couples wear? Some of them opted for simple, elegant pieces, such as the consistently polished looks we saw from royals like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, or from world leaders like French President and First Lady Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. Other duos chose eye-popping streetwear looks: Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber, and Bella Hadid and The Weeknd embraced buzzy labels, which made for experimental twinning that was thrilling to watch.</p>

      <p align="left">When Tom Ford assumed his position as chairman of the CFDA earlier this year, he kicked off his tenure with a radical announcement: New York Fashion Week would be just five days long. Shortened from its typical timeline, the new week was devised to lure more international press and retailers to NYFW as well as create a more streamlined and compact week. Today we have a first look at Ford’s vision for the new New York Fashion Week, which starts with Telfar on September 6 and culminates with Marc Jacobs, as always, on September 11.</p>

      <p align="left">Chicago is brutally cold in the winter and unfathomably humid in the summer, but there is a delightful warmth to the city that lies in direct opposition to those two extremes. One can see it in the final weeks of July when Pitchfork Festival descends upon the West Loop’s Union Park. Temperatures hit their peak, but Chicagoans happily come out in droves anyway. They sit on patches of grass and chug Gatorade, wearing tie-dye Stussy T-shirts and Jordans. Couples, who make their own jewelry out of crystals, hang out in between tall trees while teens mosh to Rico Nasty, and girls in matching neon minidresses.</p>

      <p align="left">First seen at Gucci’s Resort 2020 show, the Italian label is launching the 1955 Horsebit handbag this month, a new style that references Gucci’s archives from the ’50s. The revived interpretation features the brand’s iconic horsebit clasp, the first time the signature detail has been used on a bag since Alessandro Michele took the helm in 2015. It will be available in three silhouettes—a shoulder bag, messenger bag, and bucket bag—and comes in a variety of fabrications, from leather and precious exotics to a monogrammed canvas. The products will retail starting from $1,980.</p>

      <p align=left>Last night, Cardi B took to her Instagram to share some of her thoughts on the upcoming 2020 presidential election. In a one-minute video clip, the rapper urged Democrats to stop “putting Trump on blast” on television and on social media, and to instead focus on sharing the positive messaging and political agendas of the Democratic candidates.Cardi believes that the left has become too “distracted” by the president’s outrageous, racist, and misogynistic rhetoric on Twitter, and that it’s time to start focusing on the 2020 election. Cardi is aiming to decrease the chances of that happening by using her platform to engage voters, and she’s doing so with a politically minded wardrobe. For her Insta rallying cry, Cardi chose a pair of white pumps, red trousers, and a red, white, and blue printed pussy-bow blouse.</p>

      <p align="left">Yesterday, the model went out in New York City wearing the perfect summer-night ensemble. She knows the power of a good cardigan, even in a season where it may not seem an obvious first choice. She chose one in white by Danielle Guizio, fastening just the top button to reveal slinky, form-fitting knit pieces underneath, including a tank and skirt by Hesperios. (Talk about cozy-chic pieces that are warm, but not too warm.) Then, Hadid added some stellar accessories to dress the whole thing up: Wandler’s leopard print Isa sandals, a Michael Kors bag with chain strap, Bagatiba's hoop earrings, and small, rectangular sunglasses. The takeaway: a sexy sweater is summer’s best secret weapon.</p>

      <p align="left">Steve Lacy is clearly knowledgeable when it comes to fashion. He’s become a runway darling, walking at Virgil Abloh’s first Louis Vuitton menswear show in Paris last year and then more recently at No Sesso’s New York Fashion Week debut, and the Internet guitarist can pull off an oversize Balenciaga suit like no other. He’ll sometimes reach for more underground brands, as he did when he wore green flame-printed vinyl pants from German brand GmbH while on tour (which he paired with Margiela tabi boots, no less), but overall, it seems safe to say that he’s more into high-fashion than a streetwear fanatic.</p>
