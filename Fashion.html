      <h3>The Fashion-Forward Couples Who Dominated 2018</h3>
      <p align="left">What exactly did the year’s best dressed couples wear? Some of them opted for simple, elegant pieces, such as the consistently polished looks we saw from royals like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, or from world leaders like French President and First Lady Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. Other duos chose eye-popping streetwear looks: Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber, and Bella Hadid and The Weeknd embraced buzzy labels, which made for experimental twinning that was thrilling to watch.</p>

      <h3>New York Fashion Week’s New Five-Day Schedule Is Here</h3>
      <p align="left">When Tom Ford assumed his position as chairman of the CFDA earlier this year, he kicked off his tenure with a radical announcement: New York Fashion Week would be just five days long. Shortened from its typical timeline, the new week was devised to lure more international press and retailers to NYFW as well as create a more streamlined and compact week.</p>

      <h3>See the Best Street Style From Pitchfork Fest</h3>
      <p align="left">Chicago is brutally cold in the winter and unfathomably humid in the summer, but there is a delightful warmth to the city that lies in direct opposition to those two extremes. One can see it in the final weeks of July when Pitchfork Festival descends upon the West Loop’s Union Park. Temperatures hit their peak, but Chicagoans happily come out in droves anyway. They sit on patches of grass and chug Gatorade, wearing tie-dye Stussy T-shirts and Jordans. Couples, who make their own jewelry out of crystals, hang out in between tall trees while teens mosh to Rico Nasty, and girls in matching neon minidresses chatter off on the left-hand side of one of the festival’s three stages. There are poets standing next to DIY punks, as well as folks of all ages, present for the music in different ways.</p>

      <h3>This Was the Decade That Hip-Hop Style Got Femme</h3>
      <p align="left">First seen at Gucci’s Resort 2020 show, the Italian label is launching the 1955 Horsebit handbag this month, a new style that references Gucci’s archives from the ’50s. The revived interpretation features the brand’s iconic horsebit clasp, the first time the signature detail has been used on a bag since Alessandro Michele took the helm in 2015. It will be available in three silhouettes—a shoulder bag, messenger bag, and bucket bag—and comes in a variety of fabrications, from leather and precious exotics to a monogrammed canvas. The products will retail starting from $1,980.</p>

      <h3>Cardi B Reveals Her Sharp Take on Political Style</h3>
      <p align=left>Last night, Cardi B took to her Instagram to share some of her thoughts on the upcoming 2020 presidential election. In a one-minute video clip, the rapper urged Democrats to stop “putting Trump on blast” on television and on social media, and to instead focus on sharing the positive messaging and political agendas of the Democratic candidates.Cardi believes that the left has become too “distracted” by the president’s outrageous, racist, and misogynistic rhetoric on Twitter, and that it’s time to start focusing on the 2020 election. Cardi is aiming to decrease the chances of that happening by using her platform to engage voters, and she’s doing so with a politically minded wardrobe. For her Insta rallying cry, Cardi chose a pair of white pumps, red trousers, and a red, white, and blue printed pussy-bow blouse.</p>

      <h3>Bella Hadid Shows Why a Summer Cardigan Is a Style Win</h3>
      <p align="left">Yesterday, the model went out in New York City wearing the perfect summer-night ensemble. She knows the power of a good cardigan, even in a season where it may not seem an obvious first choice. She chose one in white by Danielle Guizio, fastening just the top button to reveal slinky, form-fitting knit pieces underneath, including a tank and skirt by Hesperios. (Talk about cozy-chic pieces that are warm, but not too warm.) Then, Hadid added some stellar accessories to dress the whole thing up: Wandler’s leopard print Isa sandals, a Michael Kors bag with chain strap, Bagatiba's hoop earrings, and small, rectangular sunglasses. The takeaway: a sexy sweater is summer’s best secret weapon.</p>

      <h3>Rihanna Did Her Fashion Research With This Rare Bag</h3>
      <p align="left">Setting her sights on archival Louis Vuitton, Rihanna carried the French label’s mink bag that had a muff-style silhouette, from its Fall 2006 collection. This isn’t your average vintage find: a recent listing of the pouch on a re-sell site was asking over $17,000 for it—that’s how rare it is. It’s clear the singer knew its value as a collector’s item and did her scouting for it. She paired the special piece with a casual, but chic, outfit consisting of ripped jeans, a crispy white top, and her own Fenty strappy sandals. Don’t forget the loads of gold jewelry, either—a Rihanna signature.</p>
