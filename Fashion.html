      <h3>New York Fashion Week’s New Five-Day Schedule Is Here</h3>
      <p align="left">When Tom Ford assumed his position as chairman of the CFDA earlier this year, he kicked off his tenure with a radical announcement: New York Fashion Week would be just five days long. Shortened from its typical timeline, the new week was devised to lure more international press and retailers to NYFW as well as create a more streamlined and compact week.</p>

      <h3>Shake Up Your Summer Work Wardrobe With These 15 Transitional Pieces</h3>
      <p align="left">There are still vacation days remaining, as well as a handful of Summer Fridays, but it’s no longer possible to deny that fall is fast approaching. It’s time to start thinking about how to transition your casual warm-weather wardrobe into polished autumnal attire. There’s no better time to add fresh pieces into the mix than during the midseason sales, and shopping for workwear will help keep your summer office outfits fresh and your commute cool and have you prepared for the season ahead.</p>

      <h3>See the Best Street Style From Pitchfork Fest</h3>
      <p align="left">Chicago is brutally cold in the winter and unfathomably humid in the summer, but there is a delightful warmth to the city that lies in direct opposition to those two extremes. One can see it in the final weeks of July when Pitchfork Festival descends upon the West Loop’s Union Park. Temperatures hit their peak, but Chicagoans happily come out in droves anyway. They sit on patches of grass and chug Gatorade, wearing tie-dye Stussy T-shirts and Jordans. Couples, who make their own jewelry out of crystals, hang out in between tall trees while teens mosh to Rico Nasty, and girls in matching neon minidresses chatter off on the left-hand side of one of the festival’s three stages. There are poets standing next to DIY punks, as well as folks of all ages, present for the music in different ways.</p>
