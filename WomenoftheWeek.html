      <p class="w3-large">Reshma Saujani is the Founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, 
          a national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology and 
          change the image of what a programmer looks like and does. With their 7-week Summer
          Immersion Program, 2-week specialized Campus Program, after school Clubs, and a 13-book 
          New York Times best-selling series, Girls Who Code is leading the movement to inspire, educate,
          and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.
          By the end of the 2018 academic year, Girls Who Code will have reached over 90,000 girls 
          in all 50 states and several US territories. Girls Who Code alumni are choosing to major
          in CS, or related fields, at a rate 15 times the national average; Black and Latina alumni 
          are choosing to major in CS or related fields at a rate 16 times the national average.
          Reshma began her career as an attorney and activist. In 2010, she surged onto the political
          scene as the first Indian American woman to run for U.S. Congress. During the race, Reshma
          visited local schools and saw the gender gap in computing classes firsthand, which led her 
          to start Girls Who Code. She has also served as Deputy Public Advocate for New York City and
          ran a spirited campaign for Public Advocate in 2013.Reshma’s TED talk, 
          “Teach girls, bravery not perfection,” has more than four million views 
          and has sparked a national conversation about how we’re raising our girls. 
          She is the author of three books, including the forthcoming Brave, 
          Not Perfect – scheduled for release in Winter 2018, New York Times 
          bestseller Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, and Women W
          ho Don’t Wait In Line – in which she advocates for a new model of female
          leadership focused on embracing risk and failure, promoting mentorship 
          [and sponsorship, and boldly charting your own course – personally and professionally.
