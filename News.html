      <h3> Deporations have become a reoccurance in the United States        </h3>
      <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 35 people as part of an operation targeting 
        families with deportation orders, officials said Tuesday, a number far lower than the 2,000 
        targeted in the highly publicized raids touted by President Donald Trump.
        Of those 35 arrested, 18 were members of families with court-ordered removal orders targeted
         by the operation and 17 were collateral arrests of people found during enforcement actions, 
          ICE Acting Director Matthew Albence said during a news teleconference Tuesday morning</p>

      <h3> What to do if you are detained by ICE </h3>
      <p>Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately.
         Don’t give any explanations or excuses. Don’t say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer.
          If you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer.
          If you have been detained by ICE, you have the right to contact your consulate or have an officer inform the consulate of your detention.
          Remember your immigration number (“A” number) and give it to your family. It will help family members locate you.
          Keep a copy of your immigration documents with someone you trust.
          If you are a non-citizen: Ask your lawyer about the effect of a criminal conviction or plea on
           your immigration status. Don’t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer. 
           While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Do not answer questions or sign 
           anything before talking to a lawyer. Read all papers fully. If you do not understand or cannot read the papers, tell the officer you need an interpreter. </p>

      <h3>Guatemalan mother begs soldier to let her and 6-year-old son enter U.S.</h3>
      <p> Ledy Perez fell to her haunches, a clenched hand covering her face as she wept, an arm clutching her
         small 6-year-old son, who glared defiantly at the Mexican National Guard soldier blocking them from crossing into the United States.
        plight of this mother and son who had traveled some 1,500 miles from their home country of Guatemala
        to the border city of Ciudad Juarez, only to be stopped mere feet from the United States, was captured
         by Reuters photographer Jose Luis Gonzalez as twilight approached on Monday.</p>

      <h3>Man leaves 1 year old twins in hot car,they end up dead</h3>
      <p>Since leaving his 1-year-old twins in his broiling car while he was at work on Friday, 
        killing them, Juan Rodriguez has been in a state of disbelief, struggling to understand how 
        he could have forgotten to drop them off at their day care. Out on bail on manslaughter charges 
        and wracked with grief, he told a close friend that he believed he had left the children at their 
        day care provider, even though he had not. “He couldn’t explain it,” the friend, Alfredo Angueira,
         said. “In his mind he dropped them off.”</p>
